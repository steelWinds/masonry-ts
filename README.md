## Motivation

The idea of ​​this project is quite simple, I just wanted a normal and simple generator of masonry grid on typescript, without CSS and other complications that only complicated the calculation of elements and their correct sorting, also I am tired of the fact that I can not find a masonry generation tool that has a balancer of columns by their height, so that they do not look equal.

For my convenience, I wrote this library, if it helps you, it will be just great!

I want to note that this library currently supports only the generation of a grid from images, but in the future I will add support for text blocks and just a decorative version of generation.
